# Augmenting the University

---

The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort at the University of Virginia is working on a project tentatively titled: *Augmenting the University*. Using augmented reality applications, this project is designed to highlight the dynamic, changing spaces across the university by making visible historical, cultural, (inter)national, (trans)sexual, and (dis)ability-related places and events that have occurred at the University of Virginia. 

## Research Questions:

- How do we make seemingly static places and texts speak?
- What can the resulting dynamism reveal about institutional history and (in)equality?
