<h1>Augmenting the University</h1>

---

<p>The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort at the University of Virginia is working on a project tentatively titled: <strong>Augmenting the University</strong>. Using augmented reality applications, this project is designed to highlight> the dynamic, changing spaces across the university by making visible historical, cultural, (inter)national, (trans)sexual, and (dis)ability-related places and events that have occurred at the University of Virginia.</p>

<h2> Research Questions:</h2>

<ul>
<li>How do we make seemingly static places and texts speak?</li>
<li>What can the resulting dynamism reveal about institutional history and (in)equality?</li>
</ul>
