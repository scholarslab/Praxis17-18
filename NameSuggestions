# Name suggestions for the project
I started a file to keep our name suggestions for the project.
“Augmenting the University”, because it is more descriptive, can be our tag line.

Here are some names, please add yours:

1. Sight seen (word play on sight seeing since we are looking at the past)
2. Locafrost (If the archive is the permafrost of an item assuring its preservation under very specific conditions, locafrost –loca- for location– is a digital representation of the item connected to a location, allowing it to be accessible with location aware technologies)
3. Scenes/ Seen (since we are using specific locations on grounds to “stage” their past)
