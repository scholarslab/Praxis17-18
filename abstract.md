## Abstract

### Intro

Using augmented reality (AR) applications, our project, tentatively titled: *Augmenting the University*, challenges the surface of our perceptions of objects and places. In so doing, we hope to cut through the thick patina of time in order to expose the historical, cultural, (inter)national, (trans)sexual, and (dis)ability-related "archeology" of objects, places, and events. Our guiding research questions are: What does it mean to augment a place or object from special collections? How do we make seemingly static places and texts speak? What can the resulting dynamism reveal about institutional history and (in)equality?


### Background of the Project

Advances in technology and computational power have already familiarized mobile users with augmented reality games and applications. Pokemon Go's success, for instance, was due in part to its melding of the player's surroundings with the virtual world of the game. A similar (albeit less popular) Digital Humanities project titled Ambient Literature (https://ambientlit.com/) likewise employs augmented reality. Ambient Literature is a story platform that users/readers access via mobile phone and tablet, and it invites readers to move to specific locations as the story unfolds; these locations trigger para-textual material to appear to the reader, including sound-clips and other documents. As such, all the disparate elements of the environment shape these unique literary works into complex aesthetic assemblages. Adriana de Souza e Silva has discussed how projects that employ these location-aware technologies alter the ways we experience city space. Whereas previously, only authorized memorials (statues, plaques) were allowed in public spaces - and forms such as flyers, posters, and even graffiti were relegated to acts of vandalism - location-aware technologies allow users to freely intervene in their public space by virtually adding their content.       

As such, the digital spaces created by augmented reality assumes a kind of openness and easy mobility that is lacking in real space. In real space, movement may be controlled or limited by socio-economic and political reasons, resulting in groups of individuals who are excluded from areas. Nonetheless, spatial boundaries and limitations can seemingly be circumvented in digital spaces, [FOOTNOTE: the same can be said about digital spaces i.e. firewalls, paying services, language barriers, profile/password credentials, profiles set to private, digital literacy] and users can move rapidly across zones that they would not be able to in actuality. *Augmenting the University* is thus designed to explore how real spaces can be experienced through changing, mobile technologies that enable spatial and temporal augmentation. In so doing, our project seeks to challenge our interaction and interpretations of spaces.

### Theory

We are inspired by digital humanities projects like The Whole Story, an augmented reality app that allows users to build AR statues of women and place them in the spatial landscape for others to see (https://thewholestoryproject.com). By putting women back in the narrative, the app challenges the unequal statuary landscape and its implication that men are the makers of history. Furthermore, we hope that by using AR to illuminate historical, cultural, racial, (inter)national, (trans)sexual, and (dis)ability-related histories at our university, we will not only tell old stories, we will also discover new ones. In this we are inspired by spatial historian Richard White, who claims, “Visualization and spatial history are not about producing illustrations or maps to communicate things that you discovered by other means. It is a means of doing research: it generates questions that might otherwise go unasked, it reveals historical relations that might otherwise go unnoticed, and it undermines, or substantiates, stories upon which we build our own versions of the past” (https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=29). *Augmenting the University* similarly seeks to employ AR technology in order to explore the otherwise hidden stories, histories, and questions surrounding objects and spaces at the university. Our goal is not to "decorate" reality but to make visible what was already there but hidden or forgotten.        


### Methodology
+ Add pictures


*Augmenting the University* will have two primary instantiations: a web-based version and an app. The web version will clearly layout both our research methods and findings, and we plan to design it in such a way that it will point toward the "augmented" or revealing nature of the project. Indeed, the second version of the project will explicitly draw upon augmented reality technology. In particular, our project uses Unity to layer 3D models on images - including university buildings and physical, textual objects - that will enable the viewer to experience the virtual layering of time upon an object. In so doing, our project seeks to draw broader, richer links between objects within Special Collection and physical spaces at the University. Ultimately, this project will inform how we reveal dynamic space by challenging participants' knowledge with the display of information culled from disparate places.

The objects of our investigation include both buildings and documents at or connected to our university. Specifically, our project integrates documents from the Special Collections Library with physical spaces around the university grounds. Ultimately, we hope to use AR to allow users to experience these limited-access spaces and objects in new ways that prompt critical reflection on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the university.


### Conclusion

Through an archival excavation in the Special Collections, we plan to unearth rare artifacts and data which once linked to specific spaces, thereby revealing the many historical layers upon which our university is built. Our ambition is to create a project where spatial and informational categories can easily be linked through AR applications, and we are working seamlessly to help expose the stories and questions hidden by the thickening layer of time. While our case study is limited to our home institution, our interface will be crowdsourced, allowing other scholars to critically reexamine their own institutional histories and spaces by adding data points and other information of their own, thus building upon the framework we have created.
