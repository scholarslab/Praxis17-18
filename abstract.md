The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort at the University of Virginia is working on a project tentatively titled: *Augmenting the University*. Using augmented reality ~applications~, this project is designed to highlight the dynamic, changing spaces across the university by making visible historical, cultural, (inter)national, (trans)sexual, and (dis)ability-related places and events that have occurred at the University of Virginia. In so doing, we hope to address the research questions: How do we make seemingly static places and texts speak? What can the resulting dynamism reveal about institutional history and (in)equality?

Digital space assumes a kind of openness and easy mobility that is lacking in real space. In real space, movement may be controlled or limited by socio-economic and political reasons, resulting in groups of individuals who are excluded from areas. Spatial boundaries and limitations can seemingly be circumvented in digital spaces, and users can move rapidly across zones that they would not be able to in actuality. *Augmenting the University* is thus designed to explore how real spaces can be accessed through changing, mobile technologies that enable spatial and temporal augmentation. In so doing, our project seeks to challenge our interaction and interpretations of spaces.

*Paragraph about history/definition of “augmented reality”* (We will be augmenting reality by connecting objects, spaces, and library data in order to break down the spatial and informational categories that blah blah blah. Talk about how both the app, the website, and the method we use are different types of augmenting)

*Augmenting the University* has two primary instantiations: a web-based version and an app. The web version will clearly layout both our research methods and findings, and we plan to design it in such as way that it will point toward the "augmented" nature of the project. Indeed, the second version of the project will explicitly draw upon augmented-reality (AR) technology. In particular, our project uses the tenets of Linked Data and metadata analysis within the UVa’s catalog (VIRGO) to draw broader, richer links between objects within Small Special Collection as well as those objects and their connections with physical space at the University. The results of Linked Data searches will inform how we reveal dynamic space, and lead participants toward more discoverable experiences, challenging their knowledge with new information from disparate places.

The objects of our investigation include both buildings and documents at or connected to the University of Virginia. Specifically, our project integrates documents culled from the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library with physical spaces at the university. Ultimately, we hope to use AR to allow users to experience these limited access spaces and objects at UVA in new ways that prompt critical reflection on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the University.

While our case study is limited to the University of Virginia, we hope that our methods can be adapted and used by other scholars to critically reexamine their own institutional histories/spaces. We hope that in the future users will be able to augment the project themselves by adding data points, spaces, etc. and building upon the framework we have created.
