A few questions about the project
- What is augmented reality? (Think about the concept of augmented reality beyond the gimmicks of contemporary technological devices)  

- Has augmented reality been imagined in the past? (who? where? how? Examples: Babage, Rabelais, others?)

- What do we exactly want to do with augmented reality? What do we want to reveal along side with what already exists? Through which senses are we augmenting (sight, hearing)? Accessibility issues? Who is our audience? How the user of our project is supposed to interact with it and what will they learn?

- What would a minimal augmented reality project be? (minimal computing, experimental and critical making, easily reproducible by others, with no use of third party proprietary software)



### Monica's Project Blurb

Research question: How do we make seemingly static places/texts talk? What can those places/texts tell us about institutional inequality?

One answer: We can use digital technologies to illuminate histories/realities that usually remain hidden. In this case study, We will use augmented reality to allow users to experience spaces and objects at the University of Virginia in new ways that prompt critical reflection on the structure, culture, mission, and history of UVA.

UVA is one case study. However, we hope that our methods can be picked up and used by other scholars to critically reexamine their own institutional histories/spaces.

### Christian Howard:

The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort at the University of Virginia is working on a project tentatively titled: *Augmenting the University*. Using augmented reality applications, this project is designed to highlight the dynamic, changing spaces across the university by making visible historical, cultural, (inter)national, (trans)sexual, and (dis)ability-related events that have occurred at the University of Virginia. In so doing, we hope to *aims*.

*Paragraph on what buildings/information we are using/drawing from.*
Our project integrates documents culled from the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library.

The technology that our project employs is *??*.

To Christian: do you mean applications just in the "app" sense or also low-tech?

### Torie blurb:
Our project uses metadata analysis to inform connections between university spaces and Special Collections objects at UVa that reveal the dynamism of both the space and the object.
