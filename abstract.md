## Abstract

### Intro
Our project is challenging the boundaries of reality while working on a project tentatively titled: *Augmenting the University*. Exploring augmented reality techniques, our project aims to cut through the thick patina of time exposing the historical, cultural, (inter)national, (trans)sexual, and (dis)ability-related "archeology" of objects, places, and events. In doing so, we hope to address the research questions: What does it mean to augment a place or object from special collections? How do we make seemingly static places and texts speak? What can the resulting dynamism reveal about institutional history and (in)equality?




### Theory - Literature Review - Question 
Similar projects that have already attempted to bring AR technology to places. 

Add a little blurb about
- Mobile Narratives: Reading and Writing Urban Space with Location-Based Technologies by Adriana de Souza e Silva 

Digital space assumes a kind of openness and easy mobility that is lacking in real space. In real space, movement may be controlled or limited by socio-economic and political reasons, resulting in groups of individuals who are excluded from areas (the same can be said about digital spaces i.e. firewalls, paying services, language barriers, profile/password credentials, profiles set to private, digital literacy). Spatial boundaries and limitations can seemingly be circumvented in digital spaces, and users can move rapidly across zones that they would not be able to in actuality. *Augmenting the University* is thus designed to explore how real spaces can be experienced through changing, mobile technologies that enable spatial and temporal augmentation. As such, our project seeks to challenge our interaction and interpretations of spaces.

Space has always been experienced through technology: maps, compasses, binoculars. While these (relatively) ancient technologies helped orient the viewer or alter the perception of distance, digital technologies are able to interject time on the spatial plane, thickening the experience of space by revealing its recorded past. *Augmenting the University* is intended to explore objects and spaces interposing different layers of temporality between the viewer and the object or space. Our goal is not to "decorate" reality but to make visible what was already there but hidden or forgotten.        

### Methodology
+ Add pictures 


*Augmenting the University* will have two primary instantiations: a web-based version and an app. The web version will clearly layout both our research methods and findings, and we plan to design it in such a way that it will point toward the "augmented" or revealing nature of the project. Indeed, the second version of the project will explicitly draw upon augmented-reality (AR) technology. In particular, our project uses Unity to layer 3D models on images - including university buildings and physical, textual objects - that will enable the viewer to experience the virtual layering of time upon an object. In so doing, our project seeks to draw broader, richer links between objects within Special Collection and physical spaces at the University. Ultimately, this project will inform how we reveal dynamic space by challenging participants' knowledge with the display of information culled from disparate places.

The objects of our investigation include both buildings and documents at or connected to our University. Specifically, our project integrates documents from the Special Collections Library with physical spaces at the University. Ultimately, we hope to use AR to allow users to experience these limited-access spaces and objects at the University in new ways that prompt critical reflection on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the University.

### Conclusion
Through an archival excavation in the special collections, we plan to unearth rare artifacts and data which once linked to specific spaces, thereby revealing the many historical layers upon which our University is built. Our ambition is to built a project where spatial and informational categories can easily be linked, and we are working seamlessly for what we hope to be a new more nuanced approach to reality. While our case study is limited to our home institution, our interface will be crowdsourced, allowing other scholars to critically reexamine their own institutional histories and spaces by adding data points and other information of their own, thus building upon the framework we have created.
