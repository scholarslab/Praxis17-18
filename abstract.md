Monica's Project Blurb

Research question: How do we make seemingly static places/texts talk? What can those places/texts tell us about institutional inequality?

One answer: We can use digital technologies to illuminate histories/realities that usually remain hidden. In this case study, We will use augmented reality to allow users to experience spaces and objects at the University of Virginia in new ways that prompt critical reflection on the structure, culture, mission, and history of UVA.

UVA is one case study. However, we hope that our methods can be picked up and used by other scholars to critically reexamine their own institutional histories/spaces.
