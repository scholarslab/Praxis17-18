## Abstract

### Intro
If in every place and thing in the world there is a story, who is going to be there to say it? Our project tentatively named *Augmenting the University* is set to explore the historical, cultural, (inter)national, (trans)sexual, and (dis)ability-related "archeology" of the University of Virginia weaving the stories back to the objects and places they belong too. Our project challenges the ways we experience the world through a combination of location aware technologies and augmented reality techniques.  

### Questions 
In doing so we hope to address the research questions: What does it mean to augment a special collections' object or a place? How do we make seemingly static places and texts speak? What can the resulting dynamism reveal about institutional history and (in)equality?

### Theory - Literature Review  
If Terminator's vision was the first popular encounter with augmented reality in the 1984 movie, overlaying on an infrared view of the world, blinking textual information and polygonal 3D meshes, advances in technology and computational power have already familiarize mobile users with augmented reality games and applications. Pokemon Go success was due to its melding the player's surroundings with the virtual world of the game. Video gamers took the streets and massively transformed urban public spaces to playgrounds, during the peak popularity of the game at least. More discretely, Ambient Literature,[^1] a collaborative DH project that weaves ubiquitous computing into original fictional stories. The stories available through mobile phone applications, invite readers to move to specific locations related to them and as they unfold in the user's headphones, all the disparate elements of the environment shape the works into complex aesthetic assemblages resulting each time to a unique experience. Adriana de Souza e Silva in her "Mobile Narratives: Reading and Writing Urban Space with Location-Based Technologies", a chapter in _Comparative Textual Media_[^2] edited by Katherine Hayles et al. explores also how location-aware technologies and net locality change the ways we experience city space. Whereas previously, only authorized memorials (statues, plaques) were allowed in public spaces, devaluing all other forms of intervention (posting, graffiti) as vandalism, location aware technologies allow users to freely intervene in their public space by virtually adding their content, making everybody part of the story.       


Digital space assumes a kind of openness and easy mobility that is lacking in real space. In real space, movement may be controlled or limited by socio-economic and political reasons, resulting in groups of individuals who are excluded from areas (the same can be said about digital spaces i.e. firewalls, paying services, language barriers, profile/password credentials, profiles set to private, digital literacy). Spatial boundaries and limitations can seemingly be circumvented in digital spaces, and users can move rapidly across zones that they would not be able to in actuality. *Augmenting the University* is thus designed to explore how real spaces can be experienced through changing, mobile technologies that enable spatial and temporal augmentation. In so doing, our project seeks to challenge our interaction and interpretations of spaces.

Space has always been experienced through technology: maps, compasses, binoculars... While these ancient technologies could only help orientation or alter the perception of distance, digital technologies are able to interject time on the spatial plane, thickening the experience of space by revealing its recorded past. *Augmenting the University* is intended to explore objects and spaces interposing different layers of temporality between the viewer and the object or space. Our goal is not to "decorate" reality but to make visible what was already there but hidden or forgotten.        



### Methodology
We are using unity to augment object and places + Add pictures 


*Augmenting the University* will have two primary instantiations: a web-based version and an app. The web version will clearly layout both our research methods and findings, and we plan to design it in such a way that it will point toward the "augmented" (revealing?) nature of the project. Indeed, the second version of the project will explicitly draw upon augmented-reality (AR) technology. In particular, our project uses the tenets of Linked Data and metadata analysis within the UVa’s catalog (VIRGO) to draw broader, richer links between objects within Small Special Collection as well as those objects and their connections with physical space at the University. The results of Linked Data searches will inform how we reveal dynamic space, and lead participants toward more discoverable experiences, challenging their knowledge with new information from disparate places.

The objects of our investigation include both buildings and documents at or connected to the University of Virginia. Specifically, our project integrates documents culled from the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library with physical spaces at the university. Ultimately, we hope to use (minimal? AR) to allow users to experience these limited access spaces and objects at UVA in new ways that prompt critical reflection on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the University.

### Conclusion
Through an archival excavation in the special collections, we plan to unearth rare artifacts and data which once linked to specific spaces on Grounds will reveal one of their many historical layers. Our ambition is to built a project where spatial and informational categories can easily be linked and work seamlessly for what we hope to be a new more nuanced approach to reality. While our case study is limited to the University of Virginia, our interface will be crowdsourced allowing other scholars to critically reexamine their own institutional histories/spaces by adding data points, spaces, etc. and building upon the framework we have created.
